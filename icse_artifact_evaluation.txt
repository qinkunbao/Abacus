ICSE 2021 Artifact Evaluation For Paper #63 Abacus: Precise Side-Channel Analysis

Abacus is a precise side-channel analysis and vulnerability detection
tool.  Different from previous tools, it can also give an estimation
of the amount of the leaked information for each leakage site.

REQUIREMENTS:

Supported OS: Ubuntu 18.04
RAM: 32 GB (If you want to run experiments concurrently, update the size of RAM
     accordingly. Otherwise the program may be terminated by the system.)  
docker
git

STATUS:

We apply for Reusable and Available Badges
a. Abacus is the implementation of # paper 63. The paper has been accepted 
to ICSE 2021. It is publicly available on Github.
b. We also provide the scripts to generate the results in the paper.
c. We prepare a dockerfile to simplify the installation process.
d. It takes 10 minutes to run a hello world example. But it can take 
several days to finish all the experiments in the paper. If you have a 
machine with multiple cores, you can finish all the experiments in 2-3 days.
e. You can access the latest version at https://github.com/s3team/Abacus

INSTALL:

1. Download and build the artifact
Abacus can be built within a docker, simply run the following command
~~~~{.sh}
$ git clone https://github.com/s3team/Abacus.git
$ cd Abacus
$ ./docker.sh
~~~~

After you build the docker image and enter the container, run the
following command to build Abacus.
~~~~{.sh}
$ ./build.sh
~~~~

2. Run the hello-world example
***Ensure from here on that you are in the Docker Container***

In order to test this function with Abacus, we need to tell Abacus 
which variables are the secret data. We use the function `abacus_make_symbolic`. 
The function takes three arguments: the type of the symbol, the address of 
the secret, and the length of the secret input. In the example below, 
the secret input is the variable `secret`, and its length is two bytes.

```C
int main() {
  uint16_t secret = 6;
  // uint8_t secret = 8;
  char *type = "1";
  abacus_make_symbolic(type, &secret, 2);   // The length of the key is two bytes
  is_odd(secret);
  return 0;
}
```

2.1. Build the example
Abacus works directly on the machine instruction. Here we build it into 
a 32-bit ELF executable. Note that while Abacus can work on stripped binaries 
without the source code. However, in the example, we use debug information 
to get a more clear result.
~~~~{.sh}
$ cd examples
$ gcc -m32 -g example1.c
~~~~

2.2. Collect the trace
We use the pin tool to collect the execution trace. The tool can automatically 
collect the trace and other necessary runtime information.
~~~~{.sh}
$ cd /abacus/Pintools
$ make PIN_ROOT=/abacus/Intel-Pin-Archive/ TARGET=ia32
$ cd /abacus
$ /abacus/Intel-Pin-Archive/pin -t Pintools/obj-ia32/MyPinToolLinux.so -- ./examples/a.out 
~~~~
You will get two files `Function.txt` and `Inst_data.txt`, which are 
the inputs of the Abacus.

3.3. Quantify the leakage 
To run Abacus on the execution trace and get the analysis result.
~~~~{.sh}
$ ./build/App/QIF/QIF ./Inst_data.txt -f Function.txt -d ./examples/a.out -o result.txt
~~~~

3. Reproduce the results in the paper
The results (Table II in the accepted paper) in the evaluation section can be 
verified by running the simple command after you build Abacus successfully in 
the docker (step 1).

We have prepared scripts to test each crypto algorithm automatically.

For example, if you want to test AES in mbedTLS 2.5, you can try the 
following command.

~~~~{.sh}
$ cd /abacus/script/AES_MBEDTLS_2.5
$ ./start.sh
~~~~

Tested Libraries:
* OpenSSL: 0.9.7, 1.0.2f, 1.0.2k, 1.1.0f, 1.1.1, 1.1.1g
* MbedTLS: 2.5, 2.15
* Libgcrypt: 1.8.5
* Monocypher: 3.0

Tested Algorithms:
* OpenSSL: AES DES RSA ECDSA 
* MbedTLS: AES DES RSA ECDSA
* Libgcrypt: RSA
* Monocypher: Chacha20 Poly1305 Argon2i Ed25519

Abacus uses a dynamic method to detect the vulnerabilities 
automatically. It is possible that the running time and the reported
leakages are slightly different.
